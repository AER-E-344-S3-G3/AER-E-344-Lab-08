\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{cp:conclusion}
To analyze the boundary layer profile over a flat plate, we used a pitot rake to collect a velocity profile at various locations downstream of the flat plate. Due to erraneous data collected from the pitot rake or a misconfiguration of the pitot rake, we were unable to generate a conclusive analysis and profile of the boundary layer. To rectify this and generate proper results, we would thoroughly review the Matlab analysis script and, if necessary, validate the functionality and accuracy of the pitot rake before repeating the experiment.
