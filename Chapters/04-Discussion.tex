\section{Sources of Error} \label{sec:error}

Our data significantly deviates from the theoretical predictions, indicating there might have been considerable sources of error either in the experimental setup, the data analysis process, or possibly both. Although we cannot assert the reliability of our analysis with full confidence—further validation with additional data sets over more time would be required—we suspect the primary discrepancies likely stem from the hot wire setup and the calibration polynomial of the hot wire.
